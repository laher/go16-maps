# maps
Code and slides for a talk about using maps in Go1.6

The slides are written for the 'present' tool, which is usually fine, but it doesn't support the race detector.

So, for running the scripts, please use go -race <filename>.go

Please see go16-maps.slide for the slides. You can run them locally using `go get golang.org/x/tools/present`
